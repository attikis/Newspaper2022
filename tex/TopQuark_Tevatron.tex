    We establish the existence of the top quark using a 67 pb$^{-1}$ data
    sample of pp collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 1.8$ TeV collected with the Collider
    Detector at Fermilab (CDF). Employing techniques similar to those we
    previously published, we observe a signal consistent with $t\bar{t}$ decay to
    $WWbb$, but inconsistent with the background prediction by
    4.8$\sigma$. Additional evidence for the top quark is provided by a peak in
    the reconstructed mass distribution. We measure the top quark mass
    to be $176 \pm 8 (\text{stat.}) \pm 10 (\text{sys.})$ GeV/c$^{2}$,
    and the $t\bar{t}$ production cross section to be
    $6.8^{+3.6}_{-2.4}$ pb.
