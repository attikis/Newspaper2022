\begin{topQuark}[enhanced, tikz={rotate=0}]{Higgs boson: a tool to
    discover new physics: $H^{\pm}$}
  \begin{multicols}{2}
  A search for a charged Higgs boson $H^{\pm}$ decaying
  into a heavy neutral Higgs boson $H$ and a $W$ boson
  is presented. The analysis targets the $W$ decay into a pair
  of tau leptons with at least one of them decaying hadronically and
  with an additional electron or muon present in the event.
  The search is based on proton-proton collision data
  recorded by the CMS experiment during 2016--2018 at
  $\sqrt{s} = 13~TeV$, corresponding to an integrated
  luminosity of 138~$fb^{-1}$. The data are consistent with
  standard model background expectations. Upper limits at 95$\%$ confidence
  level are set on the product of the cross section and branching fraction
  for an $H^{\pm}$ in the mass range of 300--700 GeV, assuming an $H$ 
  with a mass of 200 GeV. The observed limits range from
  0.085 $pb$ for an $H^{\pm}$ mass of
  300 $GeV$ to 0.019~$pb$ for a mass of
  700 $GeV$. These are the first limits on $H^{\pm}$
  production in the $H^{\pm} \to H W^{\pm}$ decay channel at the LHC.
