  \begin{multicols}{2}
    A search for charged Higgs bosons ($H^{\pm}$) decaying into a top
    and a bottom quark in the all-jet final state is presented. The
    analysis uses LHC proton-proton collision data recorded with the
    CMS detector in 2016 at $\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV, corresponding to an
    integrated luminosity of 35.9~$fb^{-1}$. No significant excess is
    observed above the expected background. Model-independent upper
    limits at 95$\%$ confidence level are set on the product of the
    $H^{\pm}$ production cross section and branching fraction in two
    scenarios.  For production in association with a top quark,
    limits of 21.3 to 0.007$pb$ are obtained for $H^{\pm}$ masses in the
    range of 0.2 to 3 TeV. Combining this with a search in leptonic
    final states results in improved limits of 9.25 to 0.005 $pb$. The
    complementary $s$-channel production of an $H^{\pm}$ is
    investigated in the mass range of 0.8 to 3 TeV and the
    corresponding upper limits are 4.5 to 0.023 $pb$. These results are
    interpreted using different minimal supersymmetric extensions of
    the standard model.
