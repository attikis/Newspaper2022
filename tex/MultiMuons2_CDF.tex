  %\begin{multicols}{2}
    We present a phenomenological conjecture of new physics that is suggested
    by the topology and kinematic properties of the multi-muon events recently
    reported by the CDF collaboration. We show that the salient features of 
    the data can be accounted for by postulating the pair production of
    three new states $h_1$, $h_2$, and $h_3$ with masses in the range
    of 15, 7.3, and 3.6 GeV/c$^{2}$, respectively. The heavier states 
    cascade-decay into the lighter ones, whereas the lightest state 
    decays into a $\tau$ pair with a lifetime of the order of 20 ps.
